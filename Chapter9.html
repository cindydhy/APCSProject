		<h1>Chapter 9: Inheritance and Interfaces</h1>
		<br>

		<h2>Inheritance basics</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Code reuse: practice of writing program code once and using it in many contexts</li>
			<li>Is-a relationship: hierarchical connection between two categories in which one type is a specialized version of the other</li>
			<li>Inheritance hierarchy: set of hierarchical relationships between classes of objects</li>
			<li>Inheritance (inherit): programming technique that allows a derived class to extend the functionality of a base class, inheriting all of its state and behavior</li>
			<li>Superclass: parent class in inheritance relationship</li>
			<li>Subclass: child, or derived, class in an inheritance relationship</li>
			<li>Override: to implement a new version of a method to replace code that would otherwise have been inherited from a superclass</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Interacting with the superclass</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Instanceof: a keyword that when used, tests whether a variable refers to an object of a given type</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Polymorphism: ability for the same code to be used with several different types of objects and for the code to behave differently depending on the actual type of object used</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Inheritance and design</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Substitutability: ability of an object of a subclass to be used xuccessfully anywhere an object of the superclass is expected</li>
			<li>Has-a relationship: connection between two objects where one has a field that refers to the other. The contained object acts as part of the containing object's state.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Interfaces</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Interface: a type that consists of a set of method declarations; when classes promise to implement an interface, you can treat those classes similarly in your code</li>
			<li>Abstract method: a method that is declared (as in an interface) but not implemented. Abstract methods represent the behavior that a class promises to implement when in implements an interface</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>More definitions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Object-oriented design (OOD): Modeling a program or system as a collection of cooperating objects, implemented as a set of clases using class hierarchies</li>
			<li>Refactoring: changing a program's internal structure without modifying its external behavior to improve simplicity, readability, maintainability, extensibility, performance, etc.</li>
			<li>Abstract class: a Java class that cannot be instantiated, but that instead serves as a superclass to hold common code and declare abstract behavior</li>
		</ul>
