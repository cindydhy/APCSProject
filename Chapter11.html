		<h1>Chapter 11: Java Collections Framework</h1>
		<br>

		<h2>Definitions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Collection: an object that stores a group of other objects, called its elements</li>
			<li>List: ordered collection of elements, often accessed by integer indexes or by iteration</li>
			<li>Stack: collection in which the last element added is the first one to be removed</li>
			<li>Queue: collection in which elements are removed in the same order in which they were added</li>
			<li>Set: collection of elements that is guaranteed to contain no duplicates</li>
			<li>Map: collection of key/value pairs in which each key is associated with a corresponding value</li>
			<li>keySet: a Set of all keys in the map</li>
			<li>value: a collection of all values (data) in the map</li>

		<h2>Linked List</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Nodes: small individual containers in which elements of a linked list are stored</li>
			<li>Linked list: collection that stores a list of elements in nodes which are linked together</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Iterator</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>iterator: object that allows a client to traverse the elements of any collection</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Abstract Data Type</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Abstract Data Type (ADT): specification of a type of data and the operations that can be performed on it</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Sets</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>HashSet</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Extremely fast performance for add, contains, and remove tasks</li>
				<li>Can be used for any type of objects as its elements</li>
			</ul>
			<li>TreeSet</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Elements stored in sorted order</li>
				<li>Must be used with elements that can be compared (i.e. integers, strings)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
