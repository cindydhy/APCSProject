		<h1>Chapter 12: Recursion</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Thinking Recursively</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Iteration (Iterative) is a programming technique in which you describe actions to be repeated using a loop.</li>
			<li>Recursion (Recursive) A programming technique in which you describe actions to be repeated using a method that calls itself</li>
			<li>Every recursive solution has two key ingredients: a base case and a recursive case.<br>
					Base Case is a case within a recursive solution that is so simple that it can be solved directly without a recursive call.<br>
					Recursive Case is a case within a recursive solution that involves reducing the overall problem to a simpler problem of the same kind that can be solved by.<br></li>
			<li>Call Stack is the internal structure that keeps track of the sequence of methods that have been called</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Recursive Backtracking</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A general algorithm for finding solutions to a problem by exploring possible candidate solutions and abandoning (“backtracking”) once a given candidate is deemed unsuitable.</li>
		</ul>
